<meta name="description" content="We are using the same drone technology we use in Afghanistan here in the U.S. Studies indicate an enormous loss of life due to collateral damage. Other studies indicate that the total number of deaths due to drones is massively under-reported and that the ratio of civilian to militant deaths is extremely high. According to the former story, “the percentage of high-level targets killed as a percentage of total casualties is extremely low – about 2%”. And yet here we are, using the same technology that has an effective rate of 2% amongst our own populace. This is unacceptable. In the wake of Sandy Hook, our president speaks of wanting to protect the children. An admiral goal. Would that he meant not only the children here, but the ones we are killing in the name of our “national interest” abroad. The American Dream abroad and at home is quickly becoming the American Drone." />
