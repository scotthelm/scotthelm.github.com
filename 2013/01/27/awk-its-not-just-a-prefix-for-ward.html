<meta name="description" content="It’s kind of a joke around where I work. I saw a data import script my boss had written that used awk to preprocess massive data files, separating them into record-type-specific files for use with BCP. Since then, I have (jokingly) declared that the combination of awk and elasticsearch is my hammer, and all problems are nails. I was looking for speed improvements for our index import process. Having made said improvements (by parallelizing the tasks - invoking the import process in multiple forks and datasets separated by modulus math), I needed an easy way to keep track of the progress. I already had the processes writing to a log file with this format: 20755 processed 1000 objects ending with: 18000 in 53 seconds The first number is the process id or pid. Since I had multiple processes running, I didn’t want to have to find the last entry for each pid and do math to find out how quickly things were going. So I whipped up this little import_stats.awk script: #! /bin/awk -f # this section happens before any lines are read. # it allows you to set up variables that you can # use as the program executes BEGIN { total_seconds = 0; count = 0; } # the unnamed section here is what is executed # for each line. In this case, it&#39;s checking to # see if a line begins with a number, and # incrementing counts and totals on if it does. # the $9 variable is the ninth column in the # data line { if ($1 ~ /^[0-9]*$/) { total_seconds += $9; ++count; } } # The end section allows you to sum up, peforming # actions to clean up or print results. In this # case I&#39;m printing my results END { print &quot;average seconds per thousand: &quot; total_seconds / count; print &quot;total processed_thus far: &quot; count * 1000; } now I can check on progress by typing this from the app’s root: cat log/import.log | awk -f import_stats.awk and I get average seconds per thousand: 50.4306 total processed_thus far: 432000 Linux and Unix have so many great tools that have been developed over the years that are rock solid foundations for new things. I found this site to be helpful as I was writing my little script: Awk - A Tutorial and Introduction It took no time at all to develop this utility. It’s simple, saves me time and makes me happy." />

    <p>It’s kind of a joke around where I work. I saw a data import script my boss had
written that used <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">awk</code> to preprocess massive data files, separating them into
record-type-specific files for use with BCP. Since then, I have (jokingly)
declared that the combination of awk and elasticsearch is my hammer, and all
problems are nails.</p>

<p>I was looking for speed improvements for our index import process. Having
made said improvements (by parallelizing the tasks - invoking the import process
in multiple forks and datasets separated by modulus math), I needed an easy way to
keep track of the progress. I already had the processes writing to a log file
with this format:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>20755 processed 1000 objects ending with: 18000 in 53 seconds
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The first number is the process id or pid.
Since I had multiple processes running, I didn’t want to have to find the last
entry for each pid and do math to find out how quickly things were going. So I
whipped up this little import_stats.awk script:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>#! /bin/awk -f
# this section happens before any lines are read.
# it allows you to set up variables that you can
# use as the program executes
BEGIN {
  total_seconds = 0;
  count = 0;
}

# the unnamed section here is what is executed 
# for each line. In this case, it's checking to
# see if a line begins with a number, and 
# incrementing counts and totals on if it does.
# the $9 variable is the ninth column in the 
# data line
{
  if ($1 ~ /^[0-9]*$/) {
    total_seconds += $9;
    ++count;
  }
}

# The end section allows you to sum up, peforming
# actions to clean up or print results. In this
# case I'm printing my results
END {
  print "average seconds per thousand: " total_seconds / count;
  print "total processed_thus far: " count * 1000;
}
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>now I can check on progress by typing this from the app’s root:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>cat log/import.log | awk -f import_stats.awk
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>and I get</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>average seconds per thousand: 50.4306
total processed_thus far: 432000
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Linux and Unix have so many great tools that have been developed over the years
that are rock solid foundations for new things. I found this site to be helpful
as I was writing my little script:
<a href="http://www.grymoire.com/Unix/Awk.html">Awk - A Tutorial and Introduction</a></p>

<p>It took no time at all to develop this utility. It’s simple, saves me time and
makes me happy.</p>
