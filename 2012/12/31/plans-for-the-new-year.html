          <h2> Plans For the New Year </h2>
          <hr/>
          <p>I made some major changes over the last year.</p>

<h3 id='i_changed_jobs'>I changed jobs.</h3>

<p>People do this all the time. I don&#8217;t. I spent 8 great years with the last company I worked for. I think the world of them. We simply had different visions for my future. They wanted me to go into a software dev managment sort of role. That did not appeal to me. I like building things and solving problems. We parted ways as friends, which I&#8217;m pretty proud of. Not only because of the amicability of the parting, but because I recognized its necessity, and was willing to get out of my comfort zone to stay happy.</p>

<h3 id='i_completely_changed_my_tech'>I completely changed my tech.</h3>

<p>I mean completely. I am an .net enterprise architect. I have delivered large- scale custom applications to fortune 500 companies. I used ASP.Net, MVC, EF and really enjoyed it. Heck, I even managed to wrangle SharePoint 2010 into a passable externally-facing customer portal.</p>

<p>Even so, I felt that I wasn&#8217;t learning very much, and that there was a lot more out there. I had played around with Ruby and Ruby on Rails producing the <a href='http://www.stuffsimple.com'>StuffSimple</a> site. But I knew I was barely scratching the surface. With the changes at work looming, I decided to make the change and jump on the open source wagon.</p>

<p>I talked to a friend who had already made the leap, and as he was working with some people I already knew, I asked to come aboard. They agreed, and here I am today.</p>

<p>Now my toolset is very different:</p>

<pre><code>  {
    :studio         =&gt;      :vim,
    :dotnet         =&gt;      :ruby,
    :xml            =&gt;      :json,
    :typed          =&gt;      :dynamic,
    :iis            =&gt;      :unicorn_and_nginx,
    :gui            =&gt;      :linux_command_line
  }</code></pre>

<p>The list goes on, but needless to say, I have had a steep learning curve, and I love it.</p>

<h3 id='my_plans_for_the_coming_year'>My plans for the coming year</h3>

<h4 id='learn_more'>Learn More</h4>

<p>It&#8217;s my key personal key to happiness. It&#8217;s what keeps me going. I plan to tackle a functional language of some sort. Probably Clojure.</p>

<h4 id='write_more_music'>Write More Music</h4>

<p>It&#8217;s something I enjoy very much. I need to do more of it.</p>

<h4 id='stay_active'>Stay Active</h4>

<p>I did a fairly good job last year, but I need to keep it up. This is that reminder.</p>

<h4 id='cultivate_voiceovers'>Cultivate Voiceovers</h4>

<p>Last year was pretty good, but I can do better. I would love to get on a cartoon, or an audible book gig. Let&#8217;s see if I can do that this year.</p>

<h4 id='spend_more_time_with_family_and_friends'>Spend more time with family and friends</h4>

<p>Game night. Let&#8217;s do this.</p>

<h4 id='finish_stuffsimple'>Finish StuffSimple</h4>

<p>I have a working implementation, but it&#8217;s using dated tech. I want to revamp it with all the stuff I&#8217;ve learned over the last year.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s going to be exciting! I wish you many joys and triumphs in the coming year! Happy 2013 all!</p>
