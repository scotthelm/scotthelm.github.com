<meta name="description" content="I made some major changes over the last year. ###I changed jobs. People do this all the time. I don’t. I spent 8 great years with the last company I worked for. I think the world of them. We simply had different visions for my future. They wanted me to go into a software dev managment sort of role. That did not appeal to me. I like building things and solving problems. We parted ways as friends, which I’m pretty proud of. Not only because of the amicability of the parting, but because I recognized its necessity, and was willing to get out of my comfort zone to stay happy. ###I completely changed my tech. I mean completely. I am an .net enterprise architect. I have delivered large- scale custom applications to fortune 500 companies. I used ASP.Net, MVC, EF and really enjoyed it. Heck, I even managed to wrangle SharePoint 2010 into a passable externally-facing customer portal. Even so, I felt that I wasn’t learning very much, and that there was a lot more out there. I had played around with Ruby and Ruby on Rails producing the StuffSimple site. But I knew I was barely scratching the surface. With the changes at work looming, I decided to make the change and jump on the open source wagon. I talked to a friend who had already made the leap, and as he was working with some people I already knew, I asked to come aboard. They agreed, and here I am today. Now my toolset is very different: { :studio =&gt; :vim, :dotnet =&gt; :ruby, :xml =&gt; :json, :typed =&gt; :dynamic, :iis =&gt; :unicorn_and_nginx, :gui =&gt; :linux_command_line } The list goes on, but needless to say, I have had a steep learning curve, and I love it. ###My plans for the coming year ####Learn More It’s my key personal key to happiness. It’s what keeps me going. I plan to tackle a functional language of some sort. Probably Clojure. ####Write More Music It’s something I enjoy very much. I need to do more of it. ####Stay Active I did a fairly good job last year, but I need to keep it up. This is that reminder. ####Cultivate Voiceovers Last year was pretty good, but I can do better. I would love to get on a cartoon, or an audible book gig. Let’s see if I can do that this year. ####Spend more time with family and friends Game night. Let’s do this. ####Finish StuffSimple I have a working implementation, but it’s using dated tech. I want to revamp it with all the stuff I’ve learned over the last year. It’s going to be exciting! I wish you many joys and triumphs in the coming year! Happy 2013 all!" />

    <p>I made some major changes over the last year.</p>

<p>###I changed jobs.
People do this all the time. I don’t. I spent 8 great years
with the last company I worked for. I think the world of them. We simply had
different visions for my future. They wanted me to go into a software dev
managment sort of role. That did not appeal to me. I like building things and
solving problems. We parted ways as friends, which I’m pretty proud of. Not
only because of the amicability of the parting, but because I recognized its 
necessity, and was willing to get out of my comfort zone to stay happy.</p>

<p>###I completely changed my tech.
I mean completely. I am an .net enterprise architect. I have delivered large-
scale custom applications to fortune 500 companies. I used ASP.Net, MVC, EF and
really enjoyed it. Heck, I even managed to wrangle SharePoint 2010 into a
passable externally-facing customer portal.</p>

<p>Even so, I felt that I wasn’t learning very much, and that there was a lot more
out there.  I had played around with Ruby and Ruby on Rails producing the
<a href="http://www.stuffsimple.com">StuffSimple</a> site.  But I knew I was barely
scratching the surface. With the changes at work looming, I decided to make the
change and jump on the open source wagon.</p>

<p>I talked to a friend who had already made the leap, and as he was working with
some people I already knew, I asked to come aboard. They agreed, and here I am
today.</p>

<p>Now my toolset is very different:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>  {
    :studio         =&gt;      :vim,
    :dotnet         =&gt;      :ruby,
    :xml            =&gt;      :json,
    :typed          =&gt;      :dynamic,
    :iis            =&gt;      :unicorn_and_nginx,
    :gui            =&gt;      :linux_command_line
  }
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The list goes on, but needless to say, I have had a steep learning curve, and
I love it.</p>

<p>###My plans for the coming year
####Learn More
It’s my key personal key to happiness. It’s what keeps me going. I plan to
tackle a functional language of some sort.  Probably Clojure.</p>

<p>####Write More Music
It’s something I enjoy very much. I need to do more of it.</p>

<p>####Stay Active
I did a fairly good job last year, but I need to keep it up. This is that 
reminder.</p>

<p>####Cultivate Voiceovers
Last year was pretty good, but I can do better. I would love to get on a 
cartoon, or an audible book gig. Let’s see if I can do that this year.</p>

<p>####Spend more time with family and friends
Game night. Let’s do this.</p>

<p>####Finish StuffSimple
I have a working implementation, but it’s using dated tech. I want to revamp it
with all the stuff I’ve learned over the last year.</p>

<p>It’s going to be exciting!  I wish you many joys and triumphs in the coming 
year!  Happy 2013 all!</p>
