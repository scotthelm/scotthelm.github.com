          <h2> Looking Both Ways 2013 2014 </h2>
          <hr/>
          <p>This time of year always makes me reflect on what was and look forward to what is to come.</p>

<h2 id='engineering'>Engineering</h2>

<p>I am working at a company called <a href='http://www.technekes.com'>Technekes</a>. We provide marketing services for companies big and small. I get to work with some of the coolest tech I&#8217;ve ever done. We use mainly open-source tools for our development. So over the past 18 months I have changed my stack from all Microsoft all the time to all Linux and open source all the time. This has been a great change for me. Looking back, I feel that I have grown a great deal as a software developer. Looking forward, I want to continue learning new tools and ways of looking at problems. To that end, I want to create a project using a functional language such as Haskell, Clojure or Erlang.</p>

<h2 id='acting'>Acting</h2>

<p>I miss it. I still get to do things like voiceovers, mostly thanks to the <a href='http://groundcrewstudios.com/'>Groundcrew</a>, and the lovely and talented Katherine Goforth. I still have friends in the theatre whom I love and respect. I would like to do something to work with them again. Looking back, I had a decent year working for some great national and regional brands. Looking forward, I resolve to be more efficient in my engineering work to allow me to take more acting work.</p>

<h2 id='music'>Music</h2>

<p>I <a href='https://soundcloud.com/plasticide'>recorded 7 pieces last year</a> in my home studio. Overall it&#8217;s not bad. I created a lot more with guitar than I have in the past and that&#8217;s good. I got to play in a talent show with 3 other guys at work. We called ourselves The 404s. We won! It was great fun, and I&#8217;m pretty sure it&#8217;s the first time that I&#8217;ve ever played live in a band situation in my life. Quite a rush. We played an acoustic version of Hey Ya! Looking back, it wasn&#8217;t bad, but looking forward, I can do a whole lot better. I resolve to play more music with actual real live people.</p>

<h2 id='family'>Family</h2>

<p>Claire and I are doing wonderfully. We&#8217;ve been married since 1996, and I feel like we&#8217;re hitting our stride. Example - we spent new year&#8217;s eve with our dear friends Laura and Stan. We had a wonderful time there. On the ride up and back to Hendersonville, we didn&#8217;t really talk that much at all. But it wasn&#8217;t uncomfortable. It was a comfortable silence. A rare thing indeed. Much love to Claire. The kids are awesome. Zach is 8 and Jamey is 5. Claire and I both agree that our main job is to help them stay as sweet as they are, and to ensure that they use their powers only for good.</p>

<h2 id='physical'>Physical</h2>

<p>I have really enjoyed <a href='http://www.charlotte-systema.com/'>Systema</a> this past year. I&#8217;m looking forward to continuing in the new year. There&#8217;s much more than a physical component to Systema, but I&#8217;m including it here for brevity.</p>

<p>And The Obligatory:</p>

<ul>
<li>Eat better</li>

<li>Exercise more</li>
</ul>

<h2 id='in_conclusion'>In Conclusion</h2>

<p>May your coming year be better than the last.</p>
